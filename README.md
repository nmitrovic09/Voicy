# VOICY

Human voice is one of the richest sounds in nature. Every individual has an unique voice that we can differentiated from everyone else. When someone speaks, the person has sound qualities that can be only identified to them. Just like we could make different interpretations of natural sounds, people have distinct voices that produce rich vibrations in the air. If we start manipulating these sound qualities that compose the human voice, we could perceive and analyze each individual's voice. This type of analysis is a powerful tool which can differentiate and recognize numerous individuals.

- [ ] But, could we recreate these recognizable voices inside a signal processing software?
- [ ] How far could we go to model a voice machine?

**VOICY** is a generative machine that we donâ€™t necessarily recognize as a human voice, but a voice on its own. It develops and builds to something we might reference to a human although we are not sure what is it. The voice is somehow abstracted to a point where it creates its own language with human voice characteristics. The listener is surrounded by an oscillating voice that continuously changes its pitch and amplitude.

The MAX MSP patch is built with various [FORMANTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formant) which are different frequencies that create human vowels. Analyzing the human formants led me to a broad control and manipulation on the physical properties of sound. This project is built as a formant synthesizer that allows you to control the signal, frequency, amplitude, and modulation of the voice with generative inputs or sensor based inputs. Everything can be adapted and changed into a meaningful analysis with internal or external inputs of MAX.
